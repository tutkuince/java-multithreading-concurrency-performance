# Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization

- By using multiple threads we can execute multiple related tasks simultaneously, making the application more responsive. And executing multiple tasks in parallel may achieve higher performance.
- Multiple threads in a single process share:
  1) The heap
  2) Code
  3) The process's open files
  4) The process's metadata
- The OS maintains a dynamic priority for each thread to prioritize interactive threads and to avoid starvation for any particular thread in the system.
  - The algorithm for scheduling thread is OS specific, and is fairly complex, but the general goal is exactly that.
